    A student-led initiative for water awareness that highlights water wastage
    and promotes conservation through simple technical systems.

    <h2>🌍 Water Awareness: Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Water is one of the most essential natural resources, yet it is often wasted
      due to carelessness and lack of awareness. In many cases, water scarcity is
      not caused by shortage, but by irresponsible daily usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple habits like leaving taps open for a few minutes can result in the loss
      of hundreds of litres of clean water. TapBot aims to highlight this issue and
      encourage people to become more responsible users of water.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>📊 Water Wastage Data & Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A single tap left open can waste <b>6–10 litres of water per minute</b>.</li>
      <li>This equals nearly <b>360–600 litres per hour</b>.</li>
      <li>In schools and public places, thousands of litres are wasted daily due to unattended taps.</li>
      <li>Studies indicate that <b>30–40% of freshwater</b> is wasted because of leakage and negligence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These numbers show how small negligence can lead to massive water loss.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🚨 The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In places such as schools, parks, public wash areas, and community water points,
      taps are often left running unintentionally. This silent wastage reduces water
      availability, increases water bills, and contributes to long-term environmental stress.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>💡 What is TapBot?</h2>
    <p>
      TapBot is a student-developed water awareness initiative that focuses on reducing
      water wastage through simple technical and mechanical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project follows an <b>awareness-first approach</b>, demonstrating that innovation
      does not always require complex or expensive technology.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🛠️ How TapBot Helps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates awareness about water wastage</li>
      <li>Encourages responsible water usage</li>
      <li>Demonstrates a practical solution concept</li>
      <li>Suitable for schools and public environments</li>
      <li>Easy to understand and replicate</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🛠️ TapBot Prototype</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the prototype/model of TapBot, created to demonstrate how a simple
      technical system can help reduce water wastage.

    <h2>🌱 Impact & Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Promotes water conservation habits</li>
      <li>Reduces unnecessary water wastage</li>
      <li>Educates students and communities</li>
      <li>Supports environmental sustainability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Saving even a few litres per tap each day can result in thousands of litres
      saved every year.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>🚀 Future Scope</h2>
    <p>
      TapBot aims to evolve with improved technical and mechanical designs, possible
      automation using sensors, real-time awareness systems, and wider implementation
      in schools and public places.
