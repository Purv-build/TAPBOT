        <h2>🌍 Why Water Awareness Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Water is one of the most precious resources on Earth, yet it is often wasted due to
            carelessness and lack of awareness. Many water shortages are not caused by lack of water,
            but by irresponsible usage in daily life.
        </p>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>📊 Water Wastage Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A single tap left open can waste more than <b>6 litres of water per minute</b>.</li>
            <li>This means around <b>360 litres of water per hour</b>.</li>
            <li>Millions of litres of water are wasted daily in schools, public places, and homes.</li>
            <li>Nearly <b>30–40% of freshwater</b> is wasted due to leakage and negligence.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>🚨 The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            In public places like schools, parks, and community taps, water is often left running
            unintentionally. This silent wastage slowly leads to water scarcity and environmental damage.
